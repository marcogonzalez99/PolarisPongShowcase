# 🏓 PolarisPong v1.0

**PolarisPong** is the first game built using **PolarisKit**, our lightweight, modular starter kit for developing 2D games with Pygame.  
It’s designed to be **fully replayable**, **polished**, and a **complete example** of what PolarisKit can deliver.

**PolarisPong proves that PolarisKit can deliver a small, polished game with persistent save/load, multiple game modes, customization, and achievements.**
