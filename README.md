# 🎮 PolarisPong v1.0 (WiP)

**PolarisPong** is the first game built using **PolarisKit** — a lightweight modular starter kit for building 2D games with Pygame.
PolarisPong is designed to be fully replayable, polished, and fun — a complete example of what PolarisKit can power.

This project will serve both as a *complete game* and as a **showcase of PolarisKit's core features**.

## 🏓 Current Features

✅ Classic **Pong gameplay** (Player vs CPU)  
✅ **Skin customization** (Paddle + Ball skins)  
✅ **Pause menu** (ESC to pause from anywhere)  
✅ **Title screen**  
✅ Basic **sound effects** (Paddle hit, Wall hit, Point scored)  
✅ Built-in **debug overlay** (TAB to toggle)

## 💡 Why Pong?

**Pong is simple**, but a great test case:

- It tests your scene system, asset loading, and input flow.
- Forces a complete game loop: Title → Game → Pause → Win/Loss → Title

**PolarisPong will prove that PolarisKit can ship a small, polished game.**

## Built on PolarisKit v2.1

PolarisKit currently provides:

✅ Direct **scene management stack system** (Title, Game, Pause)  
✅ Global **pause system** (ESC key from anywhere)  
✅ Simple **asset + sound loader** (images, SFX, fonts)  
✅ Clean and scalable **folder structure**  
✅ Scene lifecycle: **on_enter()**, **on_exit()**

## Notes

**PolarisPong** is being built intentionally simple:

- First goal: ship a complete small game built with PolarisKit v2.1
- Second goal: demonstrate clean save/load, stats, and achievements using PolarisKit patterns

If you’d like to build your own small game — fork PolarisKit and go! 🚀
